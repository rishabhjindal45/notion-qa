# Introduction

## Welcome to Suncorp Car Insurance

> Why is this document important?
> 

This Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) is an important legal document that contains details of your Suncorp Car Insurance if you purchase this product from us. Before you decide to buy this product from us, please read this PDS carefully. If you purchase this product, your policy comprises of this PDS and your certificate of insurance which shows the details particular to you.

The information in this PDS was current at the date of preparation. We may update some of the information in the PDS that is not materially adverse from time to time without needing to notify you. You can obtain a copy of any updated information by contacting us on **13 11 55**. We will give you a free paper copy of any updates if you request them.

In some circumstances the terms and conditions of this PDS may be amended by a Supplementary PDS (SPDS).

> PED Guide
> 

Throughout this PDS you will be referred to a guide called: Premiums, Excesses, Discounts and Claim Payments Guide, indicated as ‘Refer to the PED Guide for further information’. This guide will provide you with further information and is available at [www.suncorp.com.au/moredetails.](http://www.suncorp.com.au/moredetails) You can also obtain a copy of this guide on request, at no charge, if you contact us.

> Cooling off period
> 

After this insurance begins or you renew your policy for another period of insurance, you have **21** days to consider the information in your PDS. This is called the ‘cooling off period’. If you wish, and provided you have not made a claim, you can cancel your insurance within **21** days from the day cover began or was renewed. We will then refund in full any money you have paid.

> Who is this product designed for?
> 

This insurance product is designed for owners of passenger cars (including 4WDs, utilities and vans) who use their car for one or more of the following uses:

- **Private**: if not used in connection with earning an income, or if the only such use is driving to and from work and/or occasional use in connection with work or if used for volunteer work;
- **Business**: if used in connection with an occupation or business in a way not listed above.

When you first take out a policy with us we will ask you how you use your car. Also, you must tell us if you change the use of your car while you hold a policy with us and when you renew your policy.

> Your duty of disclosure
> 

You have a duty of disclosure to tell us everything you know, or could reasonably be expected to know, is relevant to our decision to insure anyone under the policy, including you, and on what terms.

It includes matters we specifically ask about when you apply for a policy, or renew or alter your policy, and any other matters which might affect whether we insure you and on what terms.

The information you tell us can affect:

- the amount of your premium;
- if we will insure you;
- if special conditions will apply to your policy.

You do not need to tell us of anything which:

- reduces the chances of you making a claim; **or**
- we should know about because of the business we are in; **or**
- we tell you we do not want to know.

If you are unsure it is better to tell us. If you do not tell us something which you know or should know is relevant, we might reduce a claim, refuse to pay a claim, cancel your policy or, if fraud is involved we can treat the policy as if it never existed.

## Your responsibilities

> You must:
> 
- take all reasonable precautions to prevent damage or theft, for example:
    - move your car away from rising flood waters;
    - remove keys when no one’s in the car;
    - lock all doors and windows when your car is parked and unattended;
    - accompany anyone test driving your car when it’s up for sale.
- keep your car well maintained and in a good and roadworthy condition (e.g. replace worn out tyres, replace worn brakes and defective lights, fix paint problems, repair major rust, repair worn upholstery and repair unclaimed major scratches or dents);
- service your car as required by the manufacturer and keep records of this in case you need to claim for mechanical damage resulting from an incident;
- follow all the terms, conditions and responsibilities set out in your policy;
- provide honest and complete information for any claim, statement or document supplied to us.

> Not meeting your responsibilities
> 

If you do not meet your responsibilities, it may lead us to do either or both of the following:

- reduce or refuse to pay your claim;
- cancel your insurance policy.

If fraud is involved, we can treat your policy as if it never existed.

> More than one named insured
> 

If there is more than one named insured on your certificate of insurance, we will treat a statement, act, omission, claim, request or direction (including to alter or cancel your policy) made by one

as a statement, act, omission, claim, request or direction by all those named as insured on your certificate of insurance.

> Special conditions
> 

We may impose special conditions on your policy that might exclude, restrict or extend cover for a person or particular matter. For example, we may not be able to cover certain drivers because of the type or value of car that is insured. Any imposed conditions will be listed on your certificate of insurance. It is important that you read your certificate of insurance carefully.

> Some words in your policy have special meanings
> 

Some words when used in this PDS have special meanings. Most of the words with special meanings are defined in the ‘Words with special meanings’ section on pages 41 to 42.

## Claims Free Driver Rewards

Claims Free Driver Rewards recognises your years of good driving experience with us starting from when this benefit is shown on your certificate of insurance.

Each year you comprehensively insure your car with us without making an excess payable claim, we will reward you with a percentage of the rated premium you paid (see page 38 for what we mean by ‘rated premium’) as a credit on the next renewal of your comprehensive policy for that car.

This means if Claims Free Driver Rewards applies to your policy it will be shown on your certificate of insurance and any credit you qualify for will be applied on your following renewal.

Claims Free Driver Rewards are not redeemable or payable as cash, cannot be used as a credit towards other policies you hold with us and will not be refunded if you do not renew your policy or if your policy is cancelled.

With Claims Free Driver Rewards we will take into account your claims history when we calculate your rated premium. For information on how claims affect your Claims Free Driver Rewards see page 37. We have the right to alter the terms of or withdraw our Claims Free Driver Rewards at any time.

## Rating 1 for Life

### From 26 November 2012, Rating 1 for Life is not available to any new customers or to any existing customers for any new policy or additional car added to an existing policy.

If Rating 1 for Life applies to any car covered by your policy it will be shown on your certificate of insurance. Rating 1 for Life recognises your good driving and insurance history by guaranteeing that we will not take into account how many claims you make to calculate your rated premium while you comprehensively insure your car with us. We have the right to alter the terms of cover for Rating 1 for Life, including excess, premiums and acceptance of cover according to our underwriting rules.

## Changing your reward

If you have Rating 1 for Life you can ask us to change your policy to receive Claims Free Driver Rewards but you cannot receive both Rating 1 for Life and Claims Free Driver Rewards on the same car. Any change from Rating 1 for Life to Claims Free Driver Rewards will apply from your next renewal after the change is made and any reward credit you qualify for will not apply until the following renewal. Please note that if you ask to change your policy to receive Claims Free Driver Rewards for any car you cannot regain Rating 1 for Life for that car or any replacement of that car.

# Claims

## Making a claim

> When to make a claim
> 

We understand being involved in an incident or having your car stolen can be a stressful experience. We are here to help you **24** hours a day. Contact us on **13 25 24**.

> What you must do
> 

### Step 1 Make sure everyone is safe. For emergencies call 000. Step 2 Try to prevent further loss or damage.

> You must do everything you reasonably can to limit and prevent further loss or damage (e.g. move your car off the road and put on your hazard lights).
> 
> 
> We may provide cover for emergency repairs up to **$500** (see page 16 for details).
> 

### Step 3 Report the incident to the authorities.

> If someone is injured or has stolen, attempted to steal or maliciously damaged your car, call the police immediately and record the time, date, report number and the name of the recording officer.
> 

### Step 4 Collect details of all drivers, passengers and witnesses.

> You will need these when you call us. Make sure you have their full names, addresses and contact numbers. If another vehicle is involved, record its registration number and the driver’s insurance details. Do not admit fault to anyone.
> 

### Step 5 Contact us as soon as possible on 13 25 24.

> Make sure you have the details of the incident at hand to assist us with lodging your claim.
> 
> 
> If towing is required, we will help arrange the towing of your car to one of our assessment centres or repair facilities, or another location nominated or agreed to by us (e.g. a repairer).
> 
> Please see page 17 for details on what we pay for towing costs.
> 

### If you have caused damage to other people’s property

Tell us about any incident that has caused damage to other people’s property. You also must immediately tell us about any demands made on you to pay compensation to others, any court actions or offers of settlement and send these to us. If you do not tell us about these and it results in further costs, you may have to pay those costs.

### How the Goods and Services Tax (GST) affects this insurance

You must tell us about the input tax credit (ITC) you are entitled to for your premium and your claim, each time you make a claim. If you do not give us this information or if you tell us an incorrect ITC, we will not pay any GST liability you incur.

If your car is a total loss we will reduce any payment we make by an amount equal to your input tax credit entitlement, if any.

In all other circumstances our liability to you will be calculated taking into account any ITC to which you are entitled for any acquisition which is relevant to your claim, or to which you would have been entitled had you made a relevant acquisition.

Any payment we make to settle your claim will be considered to be made in full even if the amount we pay has been reduced as described above.

### To process the claim, you must:

- talk to or meet with any experts we choose, such as a claims assessor, investigator or repairer;
- assist us in handling your claim. This can include agreeing to be interviewed and/or providing relevant documents we ask for (e.g. proof of ownership);
- either drive (if it is safe to do so) or let us move your car to one of our assessment centres or repair facilities, or another location nominated or agreed to by us, so we can assess the damage and progress your claim;
- allow us to recover, salvage or take possession of your car;
- attend court to give evidence if we ask you to.

**Note:** In this section ‘you’ means you and, if you were not driving your car, the driver of your car.

> What you must not do:
> 
- do not admit liability or responsibility to anyone to pay for any damage **unless** we agree;
- do not negotiate or promise payment;
- do not authorise any repairs, except for emergency repairs described on page 16;
- do not get rid of any damaged parts of your car or your property without our consent;
- do not accept payment from someone who admits fault for loss or damage to your car. Refer them to us.

> If you do not comply
> 

If you do not comply with ‘What you must do’ and ‘What you must not do’ we can reduce or refuse your claim and/or recover costs from you or cancel your policy.

> If we decline a claim
> 

When you contact us to make a claim we will tell you if we can accept it. If we can’t, we will tell you why. In some cases we will allow you to lodge your claim **but we will** need to further assess it before making a decision. If we then decide to decline your claim we will give you our reasons in writing. If you wish to dispute our decision, see page 43 for more information.

## How to establish your loss

> Establish an incident took place
> 

When making a claim you must be able to prove that an incident insured by your policy actually took place. If you do not do this, we will not be able to pay your claim.

We may obtain the following from the police:

- confirmation that you reported the incident;
- details of any investigations they undertook.

You must give us authority to access these records, if we ask.

> Describe your loss or damage
> 

You must also give us accurate and full details of the loss or damage and give us proof of value and ownership, if we ask.

Proof includes things like registration papers, sales receipts, service records, valuations, warranties or log books for your car. If you are unable to reasonably substantiate your claim, we can reduce or refuse your claim.

## Your excess

> What is an excess?
> 

An excess is the amount you have to pay for each incident when you make a claim. For example, if the rear and front of your car have been damaged in two separate incidents, then you have to make **2** claims and pay the excesses that apply for each claim.

The total excess you are required to pay is determined by the circumstances of your claim. You might have to pay more than one type of excess when you claim.

You will not have to pay an excess for an incident where we agree the driver of your car was not at fault, **and** you can give us the name and address of the other driver **or** the registration number of the other vehicle.

The amount and types of excesses are shown on your certificate of insurance. The different types of excesses are:

| Standard excess | A standard excess applies to all claims unless stated otherwise in the PDS. |
| --- | --- |
| Voluntary excess | You can choose a voluntary excess from the range we offer to reduce your premium. This excess applies to all claims in addition to your standard excess. |
| Age excess | This applies if a driver under 25 years of age was driving, using or in charge of your car at the time of the incident. This excess is in addition to any other excess that applies. |
| Inexperienced driver excess | This applies if an inexperienced driver was driving, using or in charge of your car at the time of the incident. This excess is in addition to any other excess that applies.
Note: An inexperienced driver is someone who is 25 years or over and has not held a driver’s licence specific to the car type for at least the past 2 consecutive years. |
| Driver history excess | This excess applies if a driver who has had their licence cancelled, suspended, disqualified or restricted in the 3 years prior to any incident was driving, using or in charge of your car at the time of the incident. This excess is in addition to any other excess that applies. |

> When does an excess apply
> 

The table below explains the excesses that apply to common claim types. For other types of claims, we will tell you what excesses apply when you make a claim.

| Theft or attempted theft of your car | Yes | Yes | none |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Storm, hail, flood or fire damage | Yes | Yes | none |
| Malicious act or vandalism | Yes | Yes | none |
| Damage to your car whilst parked caused by an unidentified person or driver | Yes | Yes | none |
| Collision with or by an animal | Yes | Yes | age excess
inexperienced driver excess
driver history excess |
| Windscreen or window glass damage only* | Yes* | Yes* | none* |
| An incident where we decide the driver of your car caused or contributed to the damage | Yes | Yes | age excess
inexperienced driver excess
driver history excess |
| An incident where we agree the driver of your car was not at fault, and you can give us the name and address of the other driver or the registration number of the other car | No | No | none |
| An incident where we agree the driver of your car was not at fault, but you cannot give us the name and address of the other driver or the registration number of the other car | Yes | Yes | age excess
inexperienced driver excess
driver history excess |
| Stolen car keys (see additional feature ‘Locks and keys’ on page 18) | Yes | Yes | None |
- if you have the windscreen and window glass cover option then you will not have to pay an excess for one claim in any period of insurance.

> How to pay your excess
> 

We may:

- ask you to pay us the excess;
- ask you to pay your excess to the repairer when you pick up your car;
- deduct the excess from the amount we pay you; **or**
- deduct the excess from the amount we pay to another person for loss or damage to their property.

You must pay the excess in full (if we ask for it) before we pay any claim, or provide any benefits under this policy. We will usually ask for your excess when you first lodge your claim.

We may not cover any legal or other costs that arise because of any delay in paying the excess.

## How we settle your claim

> We choose how your claim is settled
> 

If we agree to pay a claim for loss, theft or damage to your car we will decide if we will:

- repair the damage;
- replace the damaged parts of your car;
- pay you what it would cost us to repair or replace the damaged parts of your car;
- settle your claim as a total loss; **or**
- pay you up to the maximum you are entitled to under the applicable additional feature or option.

> For additional features and optional covers
> 

If we agree to pay a claim under an additional feature or optional cover, we will settle your claim in accordance with that additional feature or optional cover.

> For a windscreen claim
> 

If we agree to pay a claim for damaged windscreen or window glass, we will either:

- choose to repair the damaged area; **or**
- choose to replace the damaged windscreen or window glass.

> For Third Party Property Damage claims
> 

If you make a third party property damage claim that is covered under this policy we can decide to defend you, settle any claim against you or represent you at an inquest, official enquiry or court proceedings.

If we decide to defend you, settle any claim against you or represent you, then you must give us all the help we need, including help after your claim is settled.

## If your car is damaged

> Choice of repairer
> 

You can choose:

- to allow us to arrange the repair of your car; **or**
- your own repairer.

> If your car is not safe to drive
> 

We will arrange to move your car to either one of our assessment centres or repair facilities, or to another location nominated or agreed to by us.

> If your car is safe to drive
> 

We will arrange a time with you to bring your car into one of our assessment centres or repair facilities, or to another location nominated or agreed to by us.

> If you allow us to arrange the repairs
> 
- we ordinarily obtain two competitive quotes from our recommended repairers (where available) and select the most appropriate quote;
- we authorise the repairs based on the most appropriate quote and manage the repair process with the repairer;
- we will keep you informed of the progress of the repairs **and** will advise you when your car is ready for collection.

> If you choose your own repairer, which may include one of our own recommended repairers:
> 
- after you obtain a quote from your repairer, we will arrange a time with you to drive your car (if it is safe to do so), or you must let us move it, to one of our assessment centres or repair facilities, or another location nominated or agreed to by us;
- we will authorise the repairs if we agree your repairer’s quote is reasonable and will result in your car being repaired safely and in a cost effective manner.

> If we don’t authorise repairs
> 

If we don’t authorise repairs, we will pay you what it would have cost us to repair your car and the lifetime guarantee will not apply. The amount we pay is normally determined by obtaining a quote from a repairer we choose.

> When we authorise repairs to your car we will:
> 
- ensure the repair work is properly carried out;
- use new parts or parts that are consistent with the age or condition of your car. These parts will meet available manufacturers technical specifications and/or applicable Australian Design Rules;
- only use new original equipment parts if your car is under the manufacturers standard new car warranty period (but not under any extended dealer/manufacturer warranty period).

However, the following conditions also apply:

### Glass repairs

For windscreen or window glass repairs, we might use glass that is different from the original **but**

the glass and repairs will meet Australian Design Rules.

### Radiators and air conditioning

Parts produced by genuine parts suppliers may be used in the repair of components such as radiators and air conditioners.

### Unavailable parts

We are not responsible for costs which occur because of delays in delivery of parts. If a part is unavailable in Australia we will pay the cost of surface freight (not airfreight) from the nearest reasonable source of supply.

### Obsolete items and parts

In all cases we will only pay the market value of damaged parts we consider to be obsolete.

### Secure compliance labels

Where your car is fitted with secure compliance (or car security) labels and these components are damaged, we will try to source replacement labels from the manufacturer. If we cannot source these for you, we will obtain a letter of confirmation from the manufacturer of the car that it is compliant and that the plate was damaged. We will still repair your car without replacing the secure compliance label.

### Sub-contracting repairs

We may sub-contract, and any repairer we authorise to repair your car may sub-contract, some of the repairs.

> When we repair your car we will not:
> 
- pay extra to repair your car to a better standard, specification or quality existing before the loss or damage;
- fix a fault or defect in your car that existed before the loss or damage occurred **unless** the fault or defect was from repairs we authorised;
- pay for repairing pre-existing damage. If we agree, you can pay the extra cost of repairing this damage.

> Contribution to repairs
> 

You might have to contribute to the cost of repairing tyres, engines, accessories, modifications, paintwork, bodywork, radiators, batteries or interior trims affected by neglect, wear and tear, weathering, rust, mould, mildew or corrosion. We will determine how much you pay depending on how worn these items were when the damage happened.

If you do not agree to pay these amounts, we will pay you the amount determined to be the cost of repairs less any contribution charges.

## If your car has been stolen

If your car is found within **14** days of it being stolen and is damaged, follow the process of ‘If your car is damaged’ (see page 34). You may be entitled to a hire car for up to **14** days (see page 14), and where available we can arrange the hire car for you. Comprehensive Advantages customers can claim under the ‘Hire car after an event for unlimited days’ optional cover (see page 23).

If your car is not found within **14** days after being stolen, and we have accepted your claim, your car becomes a total loss (see below).

## If your car is a total loss

Your car becomes a total loss if it is stolen and unrecovered after **14** days or when we decide it is uneconomical, impractical or unsafe to repair.

For cars where the ‘New for old car replacement’ feature applies, see page 12. For cars where the ‘Lifetime new for old car replacement’ optional cover applies, see page 24.

For all other cars we will pay you the amount covered shown on your certificate of insurance less any deductions that apply.

> Deductions from your total loss claim
> 

When we pay you for a total loss claim we will deduct:

- any excess or unpaid premium including any unpaid instalments in the period of insurance if you pay your premium monthly;
- any unused registration and compulsory third party (CTP) insurance that you are entitled to if your car is registered in NSW. You can obtain these refunds from the NSW RTA;
- any ITC (if applicable), refer to page 29.

> Cars under finance
> 

When we pay for a total loss claim, if your credit provider has a financial interest in your car then we will pay them what they are entitled to (up to your amount covered) and pay you any balance.

> We own the car salvage
> 

When we replace your car or pay you for the total loss, your car salvage, including any unexpired registration and CTP insurance (except for NSW), becomes our property. If we ask, you must provide your written consent to help us collect any unexpired registration and CTP insurance.

If another party is entitled to the salvage of your car, then we will pay you or them the amount covered, less our estimate of the salvage value, any excess and unpaid premium. For example, this could

occur if you had purchased your car not knowing that it was used as security on a financial agreement involving the previous owner. This means the credit provider may be entitled to the salvage of your car.

## If you are claiming under a hire car benefit

Where you are making a claim under any hire car benefit in your policy you:

- may be required to enter into a hire agreement with the hire car provider;
- are required to collect the hire car from and return it to the place nominated by us or the hire car provider;
- are responsible for all running costs and extras of the hire car, including paying the deposit, security bond, fuel and any upgrade costs, and the cost of reducing the standard hire car excess;
- are responsible for arranging and paying all hire car costs for any period you continue to use the hire car beyond the authorised hire period; **and**
- may be required to refund to us any costs (including any insurance costs) we incur for the hire car, if you withdraw your claim or we refuse to accept it.

## After we pay your claim

> Does your claim affect your cover?
> 

If we choose to repair your car or pay you the cost of repairs, your policy continues for the period of insurance.

If your car is a total loss and you are not entitled to a new replacement car (see page 12), all cover under your policy stops and your policy is cancelled. There is no refund of the unused premium.

If your car is damaged and we settle your claim by paying you the cost of repairs, we can reduce your amount covered to reflect the lower value of your car in its damaged condition.

> Our right to recover claims we pay from those responsible
> 

After we pay a claim under this policy, we can decide to take legal action in your name to recover money from the person or entity who caused the loss, damage or liability. You must give us all the help we need to do this. If we recover money that belongs to you and was not part of the claim we paid, we will give this to you.

> How do claims affect your Claims Free Driver Rewards?

# Other Important Information

## About your premium

The rated premium is the amount we calculate that reflects the likelihood of you making a claim together with other factors related to our cost of doing business.

In addition to the amount we agree to cover your car for, we use many factors about you and your car to work out your rated premium. These are called premium factors. Each time you renew your insurance your rated premium is likely to change, even if your personal circumstances have not changed. This is because your rated premium is affected by other things such as our expenses of doing business and changes in our approach to how we calculate your premium.

Your rated premium also includes any discounts that we have given you and stamp duty, GST, other government charges and any fire services levy (FSL) that applies to your rated premium.

The amount you pay for this insurance is your premium and it includes the rated premium less any Claims Free Driver Rewards credit you are eligible for. Any credit we apply is inclusive of relevant government charges.

The premium will be shown on your certificate of insurance as the total amount payable or, if you pay by instalments, the premium each month will be shown on your certificate of insurance as ‘monthly instalment’.

## Paying your premium

We will tell you how much you have to pay and how much time you have for payment on your certificate of insurance. You must pay this premium by the due date to get this insurance cover. You can pay in one annual payment or, if we agree, by instalments. If you pay your premium by instalments it costs you more than if you choose to pay your premium in one annual payment.

Unless we tell you, any payment reminder we send you does not change the expiry or due date. If you do not pay the full amount, we may reduce the period of insurance so it is in line with the amount you paid.

If you make changes to your policy details, it may affect the premium you need to pay for the remainder of your period of insurance.

> Late annual payments
> 

If you do not pay your premium by the due date, in the first year of insurance with us, we will give you a written notice of policy cancellation where we are required by law to do so.

If you do not pay the premium due on renewal by the due date, you will have no cover from the due date.

If we accept your late payment, we might recommence your cover from the date we receive your payment. If so, you will have no cover for the period from the due date until the date of payment.

> Overdue instalments
> 

If you pay your premium by monthly instalments and your payment is overdue we can do one or both of the following:

- refuse to pay a claim if payment is **14** days (or more) late;
- cancel your policy without notifying you if payment is **1** month (or more) late.

## When you need to contact us

> Changes in your details and car
> 

You need to tell us immediately if:

## Report insurance fraud

Insurance fraud is not a victimless crime. It imposes additional costs on honest policy holders and wastes the valuable resources of our community. This means it affects everyone.

We actively pursue fraudulent and inflated claims in order to keep your premiums as low as possible. Fraudulent claims will be investigated and may be reported to the police.

Help us fight insurance fraud by reporting:

- inflated car or home repair bills;
- staged car or home incidents;
- false or inflated home or car claims;
- home and car fires which may be intentionally started, including by someone known to you.

To report suspected insurance fraud call: **1300 881 725**. Let’s work together to reduce the impact of insurance fraud on the community.

## General Insurance Code of Practice

We support and adhere to the General Insurance Code of Practice.

You can get a copy of the code from the Insurance Council of Australia website (insurancecouncil.com.au) or by phoning **(02) 9253 5100**.

## Motor Vehicle Insurance and Repair Industry Code of Conduct

This code is intended to promote transparent, informed, effective and co-operative relationships between smash repairers and insurance companies based on mutual respect and open communication.

We are a signatory to and support the Code.

## Financial Claims Scheme

This policy may be a ‘protected policy’ under the Federal Government’s Financial Claims Scheme (FCS) which is administered by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).

The FCS only applies in the extremely unlikely event of an insurer becoming insolvent and the Federal Treasurer making a declaration that the FCS will apply to that insurer.

The FCS entitles certain persons, who have valid claims connected with certain protected policies issued by that insurer to be paid certain amounts by APRA.

Information about the FCS can be obtained from APRA at apra.gov.au or by calling **1300 55 88 49**.
