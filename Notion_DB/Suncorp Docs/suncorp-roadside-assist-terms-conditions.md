| tow your car to the nearest petrol station or nearest place of safety (see Towing). The fuel delivery is free. The maximum value of fuel provided is $10. | What Suncorp Roadside Assist doesn’t cover |
| --- | --- |

| Flat tyres
If you have a flat tyre, we will change it with your car’s serviceable spare wheel or transport your car to an approved tyre outlet or nearest place of safety (see Towing). Should additional services be required, these services will be your responsibility.
Lost or locked keys
Where your car’s key has been lost (but not stolen), or has been locked inside your car, we will arrange for the spare key to be delivered or arrange to gain access to your car. The most we will pay for this service is $250.
In the event you insist that your car be broken into, to recover keys locked inside it or for any other reason, we will not, under any circumstances, be responsible for any resultant loss or damage that occurs to your car. This break-in service may not be offered by each of our providers. This service excludes key cutting or replacement services.
Towing
If the car cannot be mobilised on the roadside, we will tow the vehicle free of charge to an accredited repairer up to 20kms from the breakdown location. If there is no accredited repairer within 20kms we will tow the vehicle to the nearest accredited repairer up to 100kms from the breakdown. Please note that all additional towing costs and any repair costs (not described in 'Roadside Assistance' above) are your responsibility, and are

payable at the time of the service.
Caravan and trailer assistance
In the event that your car is towed after a breakdown, and it had been towing your caravan or trailer, we’ll cover costs to transport your caravan or trailer to the same location as your car or to the nearest place of safety (see Towing). You must tell us at the time of the original breakdown call that you’re towing, as our provider may be unable to transport both your car and the towed caravan or trailer in the single call-out; you may be responsible for any further call-outs and costs. | We do not cover cars that are:
— unregistered, or not in a roadworthy or well maintained condition
— unattended unless organised at the time of arranging our assistance
— not registered for Roadside Assist on our system
— over 3.5 tonne GVM
— involved in any way in any form of racing or motor sports
— modified, large or heavy enough to require a specialist or heavy haulage towing provider
— operating as taxis, limousines, rental or hire cars (including any hire car provided to you by Suncorp Insurance) or for any other commercial use that’s not covered by your Suncorp Insurance policy
— immobile in a workshop while being repaired or undergoing mechanical or electrical repairs at your premises
— located in a restricted access area except where we can enter the premises and you are willing to cover any associated costs
— located in an area that a two wheel drive recovery car cannot access by permanent road within, or from, mainland Australia or Tasmania.
We do not cover service calls that are the result of:
— accident damage, break-in or attempted break-in of your car
— failure to use reasonable care, e.g. repeatedly/ intentionally running out of fuel
— failure to carry out regular preventative car maintenance
— inappropriate or inadequate maintenance or repair, whether intentional, negligent or otherwise, e.g. not replacing a failing battery
— incorrect fuel or contaminated fuel added to the fuel tank |
