> This Additional Information Guide (AIG) is designed to provide you with additional information about excesses, how we calculate premiums and the discounts available under the policy. You should read this AIG together with our Suncorp Car Insurance Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) dated 25/11/2020.
> 
> 
> This AIG is relevant to you if you obtain a quote, or your renewal premium is calculated, on or after 8 February 2023.
> 
> Your excess
> 
> The excesses that apply to your policy are stated on your certificate of insurance.
> 
> The different types of excesses are:
> 
> Standard excess
> 
> We take into account a number of factors when determining your standard excess, such as:
> 
> — the state or territory where your car is kept;
> 
> — the type of cover you have chosen;
> 
> — the type of car you are insuring;
> 
> — our assessment of your (or a listed driver’s) driving and/or overall accident and claim history in the last 3 years. The standard excess cannot be reduced.
> 
> Voluntary excess
> 
> Choosing a voluntary excess reduces the premium. The higher the voluntary excess, the greater the premium reduction. The range of voluntary excesses we offer for our comprehensive levels of cover are between $100 and $900.
> 
> Age excess
> 
> The age excess is $400. If the driver is under 25 years of age and is not listed on your certificate of insurance, the age excess is $1,400. If the driver is a learner driver, the age excess that applies is as if the learner driver was listed on your certificate of insurance.
> 
> Note: Learner drivers are not required to be listed on the policy.
> 
> The age excess will not apply if, at the time of the incident, the person in control was being paid for a service (not ridesharing) i.e. where the car is being serviced or test driven, or driven by a car park attendant or valet.
> 
> Inexperienced driver excess
> 
> If the driver is listed on your certificate of insurance, the inexperienced driver excess is $400. If the driver is not listed on your certificate of insurance, the inexperienced driver excess is $1,400. The excess is payable in addition to any other applicable excess.
> 
> Learner drivers are not required to be listed on the policy. The inexperienced driver excess that applies to learner drivers is $400.
> 

The inexperienced driver excess will not apply if, at the time of the incident, the person in control was being paid for a service (not ridesharing), i.e. where the car is being serviced or test driven, or driven by a car park attendant or a valet.

> Driver history excess
> 
> 
> The driver history excess is $800.

> *if you have chosen and paid for the ‘Windscreen and window glass cover’ option (see page 44 of the PDS) then you will not have to pay an excess for one claim in the period of insurance.
> 
> 
> About your premium
> 
> The cost of your insurance is called the ‘premium’. Your premium will depend on many factors. Your premium for each period of insurance will be shown on your certificate of insurance.
> 
> We’ll calculate your premium based on:
> 
> — your risk.
> 
> — any discounts applied.
> 
> — whether you choose a voluntary excess.
> 
> — government charges such as stamp duty and GST.
> 
> Your risk – we work this out using factors we consider important, including but not limited to the type of car, how your car is financed, address where the car is kept, how you use your car, as well as information about the listed drivers and the level, type and amount of cover you have chosen. When you have Comprehensive cover we also take into account additional factors such as previous insurance and claims history of drivers (but not where Rating 1 for Life applies), if the policy is purchased through an intermediary, any optional covers you have chosen and for our existing customers, whether you have previously paid by instalments. Your premium costs less if you pay annually, rather than by instalments.
> 
> This is not a list of all our risk factors. We collect information in relation to risk factors from you and other sources. The importance we place on the factors we use can change and how these factors combine to affect your premium will differ from person to person. We may add or remove factors.
> 
> The premium you pay is also affected by other things including the cost of claims we have paid to other customers and claims we expect to pay in the future; new and updated data we use to calculate your premium; changes in government taxes and any state or territory duties or levies; our expenses of doing business; and other commercial factors.

> When determining your renewal premium, we also consider your previous premium. As such we may limit premium movements up or down at renewal.
> 
> 
> Premium discounts
> 
> Discounts are also a factor that can affect your premium. Any discounts are usually calculated and applied before application of government taxes and charges.
> 
> The main discounts we offer are:
> 
> — Multi-policy discount; and
> 
> — Family discount.
> 
> From time to time we might also offer discounts or some other special offers as part of a marketing campaign. If we do this, separate terms and conditions may apply and you might not be eligible for our usual discounts. The amount and type of discount offered can change or be withdrawn.
> 
> If you are eligible for more than one discount, we usually apply any subsequent discount to the already discounted rated premium.
> 
> Discounts do not apply to the Suncorp Roadside Assist portion of the premium if you purchase that optional cover. If you believe you are eligible for a discount but it is not shown on your certificate of insurance, please contact us.
> 
> Multi–policy discount
> 
> A multi–policy discount rewards you with a discount off your premium for holding three or more eligible paid personal insurance policies with us. There must be a common mailing address and the person(s) seeking the discount must be nominated as an insured with the same name on each eligible policy. If you take out a new policy which means you qualify for the multi-policy discount you are eligible to receive the discount on that new policy immediately and on your other existing policies from their next renewal date, provided you still qualify. Eligible personal insurance policies are home, contents, landlord, car, motorhome, motorcycle, caravan and boat insurance. A Suncorp QLD Compulsory Third Party insurance policy counts as an eligible policy but the premium cannot be discounted.
> 
> This discount does not apply to optional cover Suncorp Roadside Assist.
> 
> Family Discount
> 
> You may be eligible to receive a family discount on your comprehensive car insurance if you are under 25 years old and your parents are also comprehensively insured with Suncorp Insurance. Please contact us to enquire about this discount.
> 
> This discount does not apply to optional cover Suncorp Roadside Assist.
> 
> Claims Free Driver Rewards
> 
> Claims Free Driver Rewards recognises your years of good driving experience with us.
> 
> Claims Free Driver Rewards is only available while your car is continuously insured with a Suncorp Insurance comprehensive policy.
> 
> With Claims Free Driver Rewards each year you continually insure your car comprehensively with us without making an excess payable claim, we will reward you with a percentage of the rated premium that you paid the previous year, up to a maximum of 15%, as a credit on the next renewal of your policy for that car. The rated premium is the calculated premium before any Claims Free Driver Rewards credit. It is shown on your certificate of insurance. If a Claims Free Driver Rewards credit applies to any car covered by your policy it will be shown on your certificate of insurance and any credit you qualify for will be applied on your renewal.

> Claims Free Driver Rewards credits are not redeemable or payable as cash and cannot be used as a credit towards other policies you hold with us. If your policy is cancelled, we will refund the unexpired portion of the premium (which includes the unexpired portion of any credit that had applied). See ‘What happens with cancellations?’ on page 72 of the PDS for more details.
> 
> 
> With Claims Free Driver Rewards we will take into account your claims history when we calculate your rated premium. We have the right to alter the terms of or withdraw our Claims Free Driver Rewards at any time.
> 
> The Claims Free Driver Rewards credit starts at 2.5% after 1 year of continuous Suncorp Comprehensive Car Insurance with no claims that affect your Claims Free Driver Rewards. It increases to a maximum of 15% after 14 plus years of continuous Suncorp Car Comprehensive Insurance with no claims that affect your Claims Free Driver Rewards.
> 
> How do claims affect your Claims Free Driver Rewards?
>

| --- | --- |

> Rating 1 for Life
> 
> 
> Rating 1 for Life is no longer offered, however if Rating 1 for Life applies to any existing car covered by your policy it will be shown on your certificate of insurance and you can continue to renew your policy with that feature included. Rating 1 for Life recognises your good driving and insurance history by guaranteeing that we will not take into account how many claims you make to calculate your premium while you insure your car comprehensively with us. We have the right to alter the terms of cover for Rating 1 for Life, including excess, premiums and acceptance of cover according to our underwriting rules. Please note that if you decide to remove Rating 1 for Life from your policy you cannot regain Rating 1 for Life for that car or any replacement of that car.
> 
> Changing your reward
> 
> If you have Rating 1 for Life you can ask us to change your policy to receive Claims Free Driver Rewards. Please note that you cannot receive both Rating 1 for Life and Claims Free Driver Rewards on the same car. Any change from Rating 1 for Life to Claims Free Driver Rewards will apply from your next renewal after the change is made and any reward credit you qualify for will not apply until the following renewal.
> 
> Government taxes & charges
> 
> After we have calculated the amount to cover your car insurance, any applicable stamp duty, charge and levy and GST are then applied and the total amount is your premium. These charges are applied as the final step in the premium calculation.
> 
> Financial Claims Scheme
> 
> This policy may be a ‘protected policy’ under the Federal Government’s Financial Claims Scheme (FCS) which is administered by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).
> 
> The FCS only applies in the extremely unlikely event of an insurer becoming insolvent and the Federal Treasurer making a declaration that the FCS will apply to that insurer.
> 
> The FCS entitles certain persons, who have valid claims connected with certain protected policies issued by that insurer to be paid certain amounts by APRA.
> 
> You can find more information about the FCS from APRA at www.fcs.gov.au
